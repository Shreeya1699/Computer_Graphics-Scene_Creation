## Compilation steps:

    1. g++ -c Components.h
    2. g++ -c ObjLoader.h
    3. g++ -c Pan_Zoom.h
    4. g++ main.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut

## About the Scene:

The scene is depiction of a typical dining room particularly a breakfast scene. The main aim behind choosing this depiction was to incorporate all the different kinds of shapes amd enhance the work. Apart from the drawings, five 3-D objects in the form of frames are loaded and drawn in the scene. Functions to interact with scene such as to pan, zoom,pitch, yaw,and roll the camera are also used.
Few Important Keys:

    t = Forward movement

    g = Backward movement

    f = Leftward movement

    h = Rightward movement

    r = Upward movement

    v = Downward movement
